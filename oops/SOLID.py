S - Single Responsibiilty Principle (A class should have only 1 reason to change)
O - Open/Closed Principle (Open for extension but Closed for Modification)
L - Liskov Substitution Principle (If class B is subtype of Class A, then we should be able to replace obkect of A with B without breaking the behaviour of the Program) IOW: Subclass should extend the capability of parent class not narrow it down
I - Interface Segregation/Segmented Principle (Interface should be such that client should not implement unnecessary functions they do not need) IOW: Create small interfaces so that client do not need to implement unncessary functions.
D - Dependency Inversion Principle (Class should depend on interfaces rather than concrete class)
