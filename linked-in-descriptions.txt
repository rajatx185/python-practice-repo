We had a lot of 9 pointers in our batch. I still could only manage to get an 8ish. This was the first time I prioritized experiences over academics. I learned a ton about life. I became resilient.

Happy to chat about my college experience. Nothing short of a ride. Felt all kinds of emotions.

I always tried my best to come 1st in the class but could only manage 5-6th.
Nevertheless, I tried almost every time.
The school was all about academics, friends, and sports on occasion.


This was one of the best talks I had given to date. I got a standing ovation (if I remember correctly).
I talked about DevOps Engineering. The audience seemed to love my delivery.
