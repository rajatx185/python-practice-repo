"""
In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an iterator is an object that allows you to traverse a collection of elements, such as a list or a dictionary. There are several different types of iterators in OOP:

Forward Iterators: These iterators allow you to traverse a collection of elements in a single direction, from start to end.

Bidirectional Iterators: These iterators allow you to traverse a collection of elements in both forward and backward directions.

Random Access Iterators: These iterators allow you to traverse a collection of elements in any direction and to access elements at any position in constant time.

Input Iterators: These iterators allow you to read elements from a collection of elements, but you cannot modify them.

Output Iterators: These iterators allow you to write elements to a collection, but you cannot read them.

Stream Iterators: These iterators allow you to read and write elements from and to a stream, such as a file or a network socket.
