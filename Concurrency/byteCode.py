"""
No, the above code is not thread-safe because the global variable "count" is shared among multiple threads, and there is no mechanism in place to ensure that two or more threads do not simultaneously access or modify it.

If multiple threads call the "increment" function concurrently, there is a risk of race conditions and data inconsistencies because one thread may read the current value of "count" while another thread is in the process of modifying it, leading to unexpected behavior.

To make this code thread-safe, you could use synchronization mechanisms such as locks or semaphores to ensure that only one thread can access or modify the shared variable at any given time. For example, you could modify the code as follows:
"""
import threading

count = 0
lock = threading.Lock()

def increment():
    """
    In this modified code, we have added a lock object to ensure that only one thread can access or modify the "count" variable at a time. The "with lock" statement ensures that the lock is acquired before accessing the shared variable and released after the operation is complete, guaranteeing thread safety.
    """
    global count
    with lock:
        count += 1
